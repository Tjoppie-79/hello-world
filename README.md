# hello-world
First repository - Practicing GitHub Flow
I am Pierre - I am interested in how AI is working. I have done a very little bit of programming during Pyhton for Beginners course.
I work as Senior Management in a mining company - However thought it necessary to at least try and understand or form part of the tech process.
I surely hope that I would have enough understanding to complete this short course successfully.
